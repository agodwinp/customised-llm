# customised-llm

End-to-end repo for customising and distilling an open-weights LLM

1. generate_training_data.py: Script to generate training data for the LLM.
2. prepare_dataset.py: Script to prepare the dataset for training by flattening and tokenizing.
3. fine_tune.py: Script to fine-tune the LLM using the prepared dataset.

TODO:

- Check output of inference.py, doesn't seem to be working as expected.
- May need to update training data again
